Now I was customizing the Octopress. I'm not accustomed to the css and a whole project design - I think it means I'm new to the web site programming, because of that, I just rewrite and add in the theme's base css. I think there are better ways. SCSS???

My choice is [greyshade](https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade). I think this choice is not bad, rather good. I can find many blogs using this theme. But almost of all I found out were customized version.

I want to make a beautiful design blog. Ah, and I tried many themes I found in [erd Party Octopress Themes](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes). Try, change, and try again. After that, I found that my octopress repository was messed up...Ah. I deleted many files I thought not important, and copy the original part where I deleted files were.

Ok, it's late at night in Japan. It's a second before morning. I'll have to sleep. Next time, Octopress!
