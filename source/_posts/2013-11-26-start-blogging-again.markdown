I started writing blog again with Octopress, which is also again. Today, I set up my new Octopress blog. Actually, I wanted to try [greyshade/sass at master Â· shashankmehta/greyshade](https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade/tree/master/sass).

I tried it and made the blog. In today's work, I felt that I have to know a few things.

- What .sccs is. I wanted to change the looks but I cannot do what I want. Why greyshade.scss are many!!?? Fu~
- The jekyl's system. I'm very confused the number of greyshade.scss and many base.scss...

Anyway, I felt relieved to be able to make up my new blog.
